# Vector Introduction

This topic was not covered in my previous CS class, but will be introduced in my next 
CS course this term. I took the time to read up on the vector type and practice a few of the 
basics before the topic comes up in class. At this time the example code 
only contains some practice examples of how to use the basic functions of the vector class. 
Examples including proper initialization, adding elements, clearing all elements, iterating through 
the list and sorting the list.
